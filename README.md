### Hi there 👋

👩‍💻 I'm Veronica, a passionate software engineer at Planable, where I'm crafting exceptional digital experiences.

🔭 With a keen eye on modern technologies, my engineering stack includes React for dynamic interfaces, TypeScript for type-safe coding, Node.js with Express for robust server-side development, and MongoDB for flexible data management.

🌱 I’m a lifelong learner, always exploring new technologies and refining my skills to stay at the forefront of the tech landscape. Currently, I'm diving deep into NodeJs and Express.js, broadening my horizons one line of code at a time.

👯 I’m open to collaborations that spark creativity and innovation. Let's join forces and build something amazing together!

📫 You can easily reach me through web.veronicaandrei@gmail.com. Don't hesitate to connect; I'm always up for engaging tech discussions or collaboration opportunities.

⚡ Fun fact: When I'm not immersed in code, you can find me on the tennis court, perfecting my backhand swing.

Let's serve some aces in the world of technology! 🎾🚀
